I suppose 'libtricks' will take the quest of finding border-cases for the GPL
yet one more (small) step forward. Does every dynamically linked executable 
fall under the GPL once someone said `LD_PRELOAD=libtricks.so.0.0 executable'?
That seems to be a rather strange interpretation of the GPL. 
The way I (as author of libtricks) see it:
  - you're free to link any program with this library and run it.
  - Only when you give away or sell copies of a program that is
    _set up_ to use this library (or needs it), that program will be
    considered a ``work based on the library'', and thus fall under GPL.


I've considered using LGPL, but I decided against that because
  - I still don't quite understand it's terms.
  - I actually don't want a program that really needs this
    library to be distributed with any other licence than (L)GPL.
