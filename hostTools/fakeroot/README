fakeroot can be built to either use SYSV IPC or TCP for message passing.

Cases for which the SYSV IPC version fails or causes problems but for
which fakeroot-tcp has been observed to work well include the items
listed below.

  * Multithreaded applications (using pthread)
  * Running under realtime-preempt kernel


Portability Notes

On OS X, only binaries that do NOT REQUIRE two-level namespace will work.
