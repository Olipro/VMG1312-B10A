fakeroot can now be compiled to use either System V semaphores and
message queues or TCP for inter-process communication.

SysV IPC is the default; to build for TCP, run configure with
--with-ipc=tcp (case-sensitive).

Platform-specific notes:

FreeBSD:

  To compile --with-ipc=tcp and gcc, make sure the -pthread flag
  is used.

Solaris:

  Replace all "#!/bin/sh" lines with "#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh"

(old stuff)

Well, just do a

./configure
make


But due to a bug in the dynamic linker from GNU libc2.0
and Solaris (5.6, I believe), on those systems DON'T do
a 'make install', as that will put libtricks.so.0.0.1
in /usr/lib/, thus allowing (on those systems) interesting
things like
  LD_PRELOAD=libtricks.so.0.0.1 /bin/su
and now su _is_using_ libtricks! (thus making root breakins
trivial).

The dynamic linker bug doesn't apear to be present in OSF1 (1.3),
and I've been told it's been fixed in GNU libc 2.1.


On the affected systems, it's safer to just copy the shared libraries
to a special directory, like /usr/lib/libtricks/*


Notes on OSF1 1.3:
...

Notes on SunOs 5.6 (Solaris):
 The awk that comes with Solaris apparently doesn't cut it. Use GNU awk instead.
 Apart from that, libtool doesn't seem to be quite ready for SunOs 5.6 yet.
 (It just doesn't work).
