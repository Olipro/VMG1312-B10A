- symlinks aren't `vpath-ed'. that is, if VPATH="chop(/bin)=:/tmp/bin",
  then opening a symlink ~/home/ls -> /bin/ls will open /bin/ls
  directly, and not first try to open /tmp/bin/ls.

- dpkg-shlibdeps gets a sig 11 (avoided with neat VPATH trick in fakeroot,
  but nevertheless, there's a bug in libtricks there somewhere).

- readlink on a ordinary file/dir without VPATHSYMLINK set will still
  not return an error, if the file is affected by the VPATH. Should,
  according to readlink(2), return EINVAL.

- in trick-chroot, the output of `pwd' initially isn't correct. After the
  first cd this is corrected, but anyway. Should use vpath_findpath() in
  getcwd().

- nice() is called too often. It's called for every vpath
  component (vpath::vpath::vpath), needs only to be called once.

- nicepath -- is dat echt wel goed als path met een '/' begint???
  moet nicepath echt wel zoveel doen met 't huidige filesysteem?
