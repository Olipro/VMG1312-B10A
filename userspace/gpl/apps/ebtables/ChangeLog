	Since last entry:
	* <grzes_at_gnu.univ.gda.pl> added arpreply and among modules
	* <tommy_at_home.tig-grr.com> added limit match
20030724

	  Thomas Heinz from hipac.org for providing a test-box.
20030717
	* added stp frames match type
20030713
	* added support for deleting all user-defined chains (-X option
	  without specified chain)
20030601
	* added --Lmac2
	* <csv_at_bluetail.com> Chris Vitale: basic 802.3/802.2 filtering
	  (experimental, kernel files are in the CVS)

20030503
	* added negative rule counter support
	* bugfix: bcnt was not updated correctly
	* <blancher_at_cartel-securite.fr> Cedric Blancher: add ARP MAC
	  matching support

20030402
	* fixed check bug in ebt_ip.c (report from
	  joe_judge_at_guardium.com).
20030111
	* fixed problem when removing a chain (report from
	  ykphuah_at_greenpacket.com).
	* Added --help list_extensions which, well, lists the extensions
20021203
	* changed the way to use the atomic operations. It's now possible
	  to use the EBTABLES_ATOMIC_FILE environment variable, so it's no
	  longer necessary to explicitly state the file name. See the man.
20021120
	* changed the way of compiling. New releases will now contain their
	  own set of kernel includes. No more copying of kernel includes to
	  /usr/include/linux
	* added getethertype.c (Nick) and use it. Removed name_to_number()
	  and number_to_name().
20021106
	* added possibility to specify a rule number interval when deleting
	  rules
20021102

	  including kernel:
	* cache align counters for better smp performance
	* simplify snat code
	* check for --xxxx-target RETURN on base chain
	* cleanup code

	* change the output for -L to make it look like it would look when
	  the user inputs the command.
	* try to autoload modules
	* some minor bugfixes
	* add user defined chains support (without new commands yet,
	  deliberately)
	* comparing rules didn't take the logical devices into account
20020520
	* update help for -s and -d
	* add VLAN in ethertypes
	* add SYMLINK option for compiling
20020501
	* allow -i and --logical-in in BROUTING
	* update the manual page
	* rename /etc/etherproto into /etc/ethertypes (seems to be a more
	  standard name)
	* add MAC mask for -s and -d, also added Unicast, Multicast and
	  Broadcast specification for specifying a (family of) MAC
	  addresses.
20020427
	* added broute table.
	* added redirect target.
	* added --redirect-target, --snat-target and --dnat-target options.
	* added logical_out and logical_in
	* snat bugfix (->size)
20020414
	* fixed some things in the manual.
	* fixed -P problem.
20020411
	* -j standard no longer works, is this cryptic? good :)
	* lots of beautification.
	  - made some code smaller
	  - made everything fit within 80 columns
	* fix problems with -i and -o option
	* print_memory now prints useful info
	* trying to see the tables when ebtables is not loaded in kernel
	  no longer makes this be seen as a bug.
20020403
	ebtables v2.0 released, changes:
	* A complete rewrite, made everything modular.
	* Fixed a one year old bug in br_db.c. A similar bug was present
	  in ebtables.c. It was visible when the number of rules got
	  bigger (around 90).
	* Removed the option to allow/disallow counters. Frames passing
	  by are always counted now.
	* Didn't really add any new functionality. However, it will be
	  _alot_ easier and prettier to do so now. Feel free to add an
	  extension yourself.
	* There are 4 types of extensions:
	  - Tables.
	  - Matches: like iptables has.
	  - Watchers: these only watch frames that passed all the matches
	    of the rule. They don't change the frame, nor give a verdict.
	    The log extension is a watcher.
	  - Targets.
	* user32/kernel64 architectures like the Sparc64 are unsupported.
	  If you want me to change this, give me access to such a box,
	  and don't pressure me.
