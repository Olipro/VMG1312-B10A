FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES:
-------------------------------

Compiling the source code and putting the files in the right directories:
%make install

If you are using the CVS code or need your own kernel includes, do this
instead (change the include directory to the appropriate one):
%make install KERNEL_INCLUDES=/usr/src/linux/include

WHAT GETS INSTALLED?
--------------------

- The ebtables manual gets installed in /usr/local/man/man8
  To put the manual somewhere else, include MANDIR=<<man-path/man>> as
  option on the command line.
  The Makefile will append /man8/ebtables.8.
- ethertypes is by default placed in /etc/, if you
  want to change this, include ETHERTYPESPATH=<<path>>.
- the userspace program ebtables is compiled and the executable is copied
  by default to /sbin/ebtables. If you want to put the executable
  somewhere else, include BINPATH=<<path>>.

That's all
