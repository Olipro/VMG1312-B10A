Answering y here disables option -y for the sar command.
We found that 2.2.x kernels (with x <= 15) have an SMP race condition, that
the sar command may trigger when it reads the /proc/tty/driver/serial file.
Consequences are a machine that freezes after several minutes (or several days)
uptime.
This kernel bug concerns only SMP machines with older 2.2.x kernels. The bug
has been fixed with kernel 2.2.16 and later.
Answer y here if you have an SMP machine with a 2.2.x kernel (x <= 15).
