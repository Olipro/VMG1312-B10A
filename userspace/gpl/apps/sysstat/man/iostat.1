.SH NAME
iostat \- Report Central Processing Unit (CPU) statistics and input/output
statistics for devices, partitions and network filesystems (NFS).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iostat [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -N ] [ -n ] [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ -x ] [ -z ] [
.I device
.B [...] | ALL ] [ -p [
.I device
.B [,...] | ALL ] ] [
.I interval
.B [
.I count
.B ] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B iostat
command is used for monitoring system input/output device
loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation
to their average transfer rates. The
.B iostat
command generates reports
that can be used to change system configuration to better balance
the input/output load between physical disks.

The first report generated by the
.B iostat
command provides statistics
concerning the time since the system was booted. Each subsequent report
covers the time since the previous report. All statistics are reported
each time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a
CPU header row followed by a row of
CPU statistics. On
multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated system-wide
as averages among all processors. A device header row is displayed
followed by a line of statistics for each device that is configured.
When option -n is used, an NFS header row is displayed followed by
a line of statistics for each network filesystem that is mounted.

The
.I interval
parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between
each report. The first report contains statistics for the time since
system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains statistics
collected during the interval since the previous report. The
.I count
parameter can be specified in conjunction with the
.I interval
parameter. If the
.I count
parameter is specified, the value of
.I count
determines the number of reports generated at
.I interval
seconds apart. If the
.I interval
parameter is specified without the
.I count
parameter, the
.B iostat
command generates reports continuously.

.SH REPORTS
The
.B iostat
command generates three types of reports, the CPU
Utilization report, the Device Utilization report and
the Network Filesystem report.
.IP "CPU Utilization Report"
The first report generated by the
.B iostat
command is the CPU
Utilization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU values are
global averages among all processors.
The report has the following format:

.B %user
.RS
.RS
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level (application).
.RE

.B %nice
.RS
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the user level with nice priority.
.RE

.B %system
.RS
Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
executing at the system level (kernel).
.RE

.B %iowait
.RS
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which
the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
.RE

.B %steal
.RS
Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU
or CPUs while the hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
.RE

.B %idle
.RS
Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system
did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.
.RE
.RE
.IP "Device Utilization Report"
The second report generated by the
.B iostat
command is the Device Utilization
Report. The device report provides statistics on a per physical device
or partition basis. Block devices for which statistics are to be displayed
may be entered on the command line. Partitions may also be entered on the
command line providing that option -x is not used.
If no device nor partition
is entered, then statistics are displayed
for every device used by the system, and
providing that the kernel maintains statistics for it.
If the
.B ALL
keyword is given on the command line, then statistics are
displayed for every device defined by the system, including those
that have never been used.
The report may show the following fields,
depending on the flags used:

.B Device:
.RS
.RS
This column gives the device (or partition) name, which is displayed as
.IR hdisk n
with 2.2 kernels, for the nth device. It is displayed as
.IR dev m-n
with 2.4 kernels, where
.B m
is the major number of the device, and
.B n
a distinctive number.
With newer kernels, the device name as listed in the /dev directory
is displayed.

.RE
.B tps

indeterminate size.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c
Display the CPU utilization report.
.IP -d
Display the device utilization report.
.IP -h
Make the NFS report displayed by option -n easier to read by a human.
.IP -k
Display statistics in kilobytes per second instead of blocks per second.
Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.
.IP -m
Display statistics in megabytes per second instead of blocks or
kilobytes per second.
Data displayed are valid only with kernels 2.4 and later.
.IP -N
Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper devices.
Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.
.IP -n
Display the network filesystem (NFS) report. This option works only with kernel
2.6.17 and later.
.IP "-p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]"
The -p option displays statistics for
block devices and all their partitions that are used by the system.
If a device name is entered on the command line, then statistics for it
and all its partitions are displayed. Last, the
.B ALL
keyword indicates that statistics have to be displayed for all the block
devices and partitions defined by the system, including those that have
never been used.
Note that this option works only with post 2.5 kernels.
.IP -t
Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp format may depend
on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment variable (see below).
.IP -V
Print version number then exit.
.IP -x
Display extended statistics.
This option works with
post 2.5 kernels since it needs /proc/diskstats file or a mounted sysfs to
get the statistics. This option may also work with older kernels (e.g. 2.4)
only if extended statistics are available in /proc/partitions (the kernel
needs to be patched for that).
.IP -z
Tell iostat to omit output for any devices for which there was no activity
during the sample period.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The
.B iostat
command takes into account the following environment variable:

.IP S_TIME_FORMAT
If this variable exists and its value is
.BR ISO
then the current locale will be ignored when printing the date in the report
header. The
.B iostat
command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.
The timestamp displayed with option -t will also be compliant with ISO 8601
format.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B iostat
.RS
Display a single history since boot report for all CPU and Devices.

.RE
.B iostat -d 2
.RS
Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.

.RE
.B iostat -d 2 6
.RS
Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.

.RE
.B iostat -x hda hdb 2 6
.RS
Display six reports of extended statistics at two second intervals for devices
hda and hdb.

.RE
.B iostat -p sda 2 6
.RS
Display six reports at two second intervals for device sda and all its
partitions (sda1, etc.)
.SH BUGS

filesystem must be mounted for
.B iostat
to work.

Extended statistics are available only with post 2.5 kernels.
.SH FILES
