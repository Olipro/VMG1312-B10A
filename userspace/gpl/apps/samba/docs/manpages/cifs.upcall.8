.SH "NAME"
cifs.upcall - Userspace upcall helper for Common Internet File System (CIFS)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 1
cifs\.upcall [\-c] [\-v] {keyid}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\.
.PP
cifs\.upcall is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client filesystem\. There are a number of activities that the kernel cannot easily do itself\. This program is a callout program that does these things for the kernel and then returns the result\.
.PP
cifs\.upcall is generally intended to be run when the kernel calls request\-key(8)
for a particular key type\. While it can be run directly from the command\-line, it\'s not generally intended to be run that way\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
When handling a kerberos upcall, use a service principal that starts with "cifs/"\. The default is to use the "host/" service principal\.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL"
.PP
cifs\.upcall is designed to be called from the kernel via the request\-key callout program\. This requres that request\-key be told where and how to call this program\. The current cifs\.upcall program handles two different key types:
.PP
cifs\.spnego
.RS 4
This keytype is for retrieving kerberos session keys
.RE
.PP
dns_resolver
.RS 4
This key type is for resolving hostnames into IP addresses
.RE
.PP
To make this program useful for CIFS, you\'ll need to set up entries for them in request\-key\.conf(5)\. Here\'s an example of an entry for each key type:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
#OPERATION  TYPE           D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2\.\.\.
#=========  =============  = = ==========================================
create	    cifs\.spnego    * * /usr/local/sbin/cifs\.upcall \-c %k
create      dns_resolver   * * /usr/local/sbin/cifs\.upcall %k
