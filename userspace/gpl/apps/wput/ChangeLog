Fri Apr 07 14:12:33 CET 2006
	* fixed the bar_update function which was too busy printing
	  out updates. limited to 10 updates per second
	* fixed the bar_creating function which called get_terminal_size
	  even in background mode, causing strange errors afterwards

Thu Apr 06 23:05:49 CET 2006
	* changed SOCKET_ERROR to SOCK_ERROR because SOCKET_ERROR
	  is somewhat defined by winsock in w32
	* minor other changes to help compilation for win32

Wed Apr 05 12:57:10 CET 2006
	* fixing a bug in get_relative_path which returned
	  false data for pathcombinations like "a","abc"

Tue Apr 04 18:46:34 CET 2006 wput-0.6
	* using gnutls now. adjusting includes. no need for win32
	* parsing of mdtm forgot to decrease the month. fixed
	* setting target_fsize to -1 to indicate unexisting files,
	  so that wput will upload even files with 0 filesize
	* fixing double free() of hostname if the host could not be
	  resolved
	* fixing reported bug in Makefile
	* adding support for .netrc-files as suggested by a patch
	  of Alexander Pohoyda
	* when sending or parsing PORT/PASV commands, now using
	  htons to convert to network byte order

Thu May 26 09:30:54 CET 2005
	* buffer-allocation in http-proxy-module forgot to count five
	  additional bytes for the port-value which led to segfaults

Sun May  1 10:00:16 CET 2005
	* fixed a calculation for calculate_transfer_rate that caused an
	  data-overflow for rates beyond 210 KiB/s
	* another fix for set_resuming because the last fix made things even
	  worse. works fine now ;)

Fri Apr 29 16:53:14 CET 2005
	* minor fix in set_resuming which mixed up some cases

Wed Mar 23 10:32:41 CET 2005
	* fix for base64-routine which forgot to set the last character to \0

Sat Feb  5 20:37:09 CET 2005 wput-pre0.6
	* making compilation for windows work (ssllib in dll, some
	  modifications (sslib_in_use flag), strptime included, some
	  fixes for *nix-header-files)

Tue Feb  2 22:10:45 CET 2005
	* added support for i18n (configure, gettext, setlocale etc.)
	* messages have been prepared
	* german translation is complete

Sun Jan 30 14:00:56 CET 2005 wput-0.5.9
	* added the --no-directories flag forcing wput not to create any
	  remote directories.
	* added the --basename param that allows to specify a base-path-
	  name which is snipped off the filename when connecting them to
	  an url

Sat Jan 29 13:54:26 CET 2005
	* set up an error-level-indication (see manpage)
	* added additional status-information telling about the number of
	  files failed and skipped
	* made LIST work again
	* directory_add_dir() needs to save a cpy of the directory name

Thu Jan 27 19:23:01 CET 2005
	* [ lots of changes. dull brain had a memory-leak and forgot them ]
	* fixed some issues with resume-tables
	* fixed the get_relative_path function
	* removed several memory-allocation problems with the new ftp/socket-
	  libary objects

Sun Jan 23 11:27:30 CET 2005
	* created an ftp-library ftplib.[ch] which contains more or less
	  the general ftp-function from ftp.c. Those functions work on an
	  ftp_con-object which is independent of any fsession. Each
	  fession contains a reference to an ftp_con-object representing
	  the current connection. The cc-object therefore is gone.
	* do_send was cleaned up and lots of its code was moved to some
	  seperate functions
	* fsession_transmit moved to ftp.c with some minor modifications
	* added a function proxy_accept which is used by
	  ftp_complete_data-connection which does the piece of work needed
	  to complete a data-connection after a STOR or LIST command

Thu Jan 20 11:22:13 CET 2005
	* renamed socket.[ch] to socketlib.[ch] as these reserved names
	  caused some trouble on some systems
	* code-cleanup, more general functions and a slightly more object-
	  orientated design bring socketlib quit near to a standalone module
	* all the constant-defines moved from wput.h to constants.h

Wed Jan 19 09:17:02 CET 2005
	* basic implementation of tls-encryption
	* adjustment of configure.in and config.h.in to determine whether
	  openssl is available
	* config.h moved to src/
	* ftp-ls.c is now wget's one made workable with some
	  #define directives and some dummy-functions as proposed by
	  Steven M. Schweda
	* fsessions are automatically sorted into the queue

Sun Jan 09 22:44:19 CET 2005
	* parse_url now looks for the last @ char, thus usernames containing
	  an @ will be valid as well

Mon Nov 22 20:32:07 CET 2004	wput 0.5
	* clear_path was also called when target_dname was 0 > segfault. fixed
	* queue.c#409 removes not only strlen(file) chars, but strlen(file)-1
	* get_msg() sets cc.r.reply to 0 after freeing it

Fri Nov 19 22:42:43 CET 2004
	* little fixes for problems causing troubles when compiling for win32
	* fix for do_mdtm which forgot to parse the returned date
	* do_abor() and functions using it, return ERR_RECONNECT if it fails
	* updated the documentation (manpage,USAGE.examples: timestamping)

Thu Nov 18 13:45:57 CET 2004
	* queue.c#469 now creates a cpy of fsession->local_fname (otherwise
	  free()ing causes undefined behaviour)...
	* fixed the problem in bar_update() that caused the old-style
	  interface to output 101K, 151K and so on instead of n*50K...
	* improved the background-mode (setsid, freopen)

Wed Nov 17 15:34:08 CET 2004
	* added proxy_listen also returns the ip on which the proxy listens
	  on, which can be different to the proxy_ip (e.g. different
	  interfaces)
	* added parse_passive_string() which retrieves the ip as well.
	  the data connection is therefore established to this ip and not to
	  the server's ip (although they are almost always the same)

Sat Nov 13 11:57:04 CET 2004
	* parse_url() confused username/password
	* fix for some segfaults
	* do_login() changed the empty (NULL) password to "" which led to
	  confusion in skipd_list.
	* minimum terminal-size is set to 45 characters. otherwise old
	  output-format is being used...
	* fixed parse_proxy which did not work a bit

Sun Nov 7 11:11:34 CET 2004	wput-pre0.5
	* implemented the random-wait feature
	* fsession_compare also compares the hostname if available
	* some minor bugfixes
	* updated the documentation

Sat Nov 6 13:35:41 CET 2004
	* added a do_mdtm method to retrieve the modification time using the
	  MDTM command. if it fails the old LIST method is used.
	* do_size() now falls back to LIST if SIZE fails for some reason.
	* do_send() is now more certain concerning error-levels
	* added retry_wait()
	* fsession_transmit evaluates error-levels...
	* the skipd_list now features the hostname in case that the ip
	  could not be resolved locally

Sun Nov 3 08:35:29 CET 2004
	* serious changes in local/remote file-input-processing/guessing (see
	  website, USAGE.examples / wut(1))
	* rewrite the parse_url function which is now more readable and
	  "slightly" smaller
	* parse_url tries to get a password from password-list if none was
	  specified.
	* added parse_proxy which tries to read proxy-information from
	  env('ftp_proxy')
	* several fixes for new memory-leaks etc
	* members of current-connection are initialised in do_connect.
	  those who have to be free()d are disallocated in do_quit.
	* added a clear_path function that removes ./ and dir/.. from paths so
	  that get_relative_dir, which has been change to work with directories 
	  that do not start and end with a slash, will work better

Sun Oct 24 10:48:14 CEST 2004
	* unescape() now stops on \0-chars
	* do_cwd() unescapes the url prior to cwding
	* placed long_do_cwd() before try_do_cwd, which now only tries to
	  CWD and to MKD if CWDing fails.
	* long_do_cwd() unescapes each part between / and / of the url and
	  cwds there. so an url could look like ftp//server/%2fhome/doe/
	  and wput will do 'CWD /hopme' and 'CWD doe'.
	* removed indexOf and replaced all references with strtok or strchr
	* url-parsing excludes the leading slash on directory-names and
	  unescapes the filename.
	* added support for a password-file (<host>\t<user>\t<pass>\n)

Sat Oct 23 22:23:32 CEST 2004
	* giving up int64 support since there seems to be no
	  platform-indepentend standart... int64-types remain there. maybe one
	  day it will be possible
	* all sockets will now use closesocket() to be closed. win32-sockets
	  will additionally use shutdown(s,SD_BOTH) before being closed, for
	  being sure the FIN-packet is issued and the ftp-server notices e.g.
	  the data-connection to be completed.
	* added support for rfc-compatible multiline messages (section 4.2)
	* do_connect now receives and handles the first ftp-message

Tue Oct 12 10:41:20 CEST 2004
	* added further informative output for errors (ftp-reply-line)
	* implementation, documentation and handling of error-levels
	* win32 uses WSAEINTR instead of EINTR

Thu Oct  7 13:22:36 CEST 2004
	* rewrite of get_msg(), should be fool-proof now.
	  returns a error_level and saves the reply in the current_connection struct.
	  => need to rewrite all functions using get_msg()
	* added read_socket_line()
	* added current_connection struct. its members where mainly taken from
	  global_options.

Around Thu Sep 16 22:33:16 CEST 2004
	* Reorganizing some code (structure, comments, todos)
	* Adding some fail-aware low-level read/write-functions
	  => Getting clear about return values => Error handling
