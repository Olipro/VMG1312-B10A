 o testing, testing, bug-reporting and fixing :)

Simple Todo List, ordered by relevance and likelyness of implementation:
 o l10n
 o support for files >2gb
 o configure.in -> look what the system provides -> use it in the source
 o ipv6 compatibility
 o temporary upload filename. rename afterwards
 o smart resuming (compare last bytes of the file)
 o better ascii mode transfer (resume etc)
 o scripting support
 o wdel, for deletion of remote files, synch option
 o HTTP/1.1 PUT / WebDAV

Specific Tasks:
# add a --no-tls option
# add an option for keep-permissions. so restore the file-permissions
  using the SITE chmod command
# some error-messages are given twice or even more times in different
  code-levels. check them and remove unneccessary ones.
