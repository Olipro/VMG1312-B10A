# Warning:
#   Since wput 0.6 the password-file is deprecated. Please use the .netrc-file
#   instead.
#
# A password-file is a collection of usernames and passwords for several
# ftp-hosts. By using the password-file you don't have to type the password
# in the url/commandline...
# The format must match exactly:
# [host][tab][user][tab][password][newline]
# e.g.:
ftp.somewhere.org	anonymous	houston@somewhere.org
ftp.somewhere.org	nouser		gabagandalf
# for ftp://ftp.somewhere.org Wput will use the the first entry.
# for ftp://nouser@ftp.somewhere.org Wput will use gabagandalf as password.
