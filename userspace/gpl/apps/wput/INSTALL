Linux-like machines (using unaligned data structures)
===================
  wput 0.6: run
    1) ./configure; make
    2) make install
   *3) make uninstall
 
  TLS support is optional and by default enabled, if gnutls-openssl
  is found. To disable TLS, run:
    ./configure --without-ssl

  If you want to compile Wput with memory-debugging-support, run
    ./configure --enable-memdbg
    make clean
    make
    
  You can reduce the size of the Wput executable by removing the
  debug-information using:
    ./configure --disable-g-switch
    make clean
    make
    
Fedora Core
===========
  Someone told me, it is necessary to edit the Makefile and change
  the first line to
    prefix	= /usr/share

Windows
=======
  Use either the precompiled exe or use the MSVC6-project
  in src/msvcpp, to compile your own. In this case you will
  have to copy src/msvcpp/config.h.ms to src/config.h
  Wput will compile with ssl-support enabled, but will require
  ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll to be able to use these features.
  You might consider copying the exe to %WINDIR% for easy
  command-line access from all locations.
  
SCO
===
  If you are using SCO (i know from someone using SCO-openserver)
  you have to do some extrawork:
  I don't know why, but make does not compile getopt/getopt.c and
  getopt/getopt1.c so this has to be done by hand:
    cd src/getopt
    gcc -c getopt.c
    gcc -c getopt1.c
  There might also be a problem with the isspace function that
  might be predefined on your system, so it should work if you
  delete these lines if your compiler complains.
