A simple mail sender via SMTP protocol (RFC-821) for MS Windows NT/2000.

I needed to send a piece of alert mail from a program in a networked NT 
machine, but could not find a simple program like this installed. So I 
wrote one. You might find it useful in some situations.

I don't have any plan to port it to Unix. Unix has many nifty little tools
like this.

Version: @(#) mailsend 1.3 http://www.muquit.com/

usage: mailsend [options]
Where the options are:
   -d     domain*      - domain name for SMTP Helo
   -smtp  hostname/IP* - of the SMTP server
   -p     SMTP port    - SMTP port
   -t     to,to..*     - email address/es of the reciepient/s
   -c     cc,cc..      - Carbon copy address/es
   -b     bcc,bcc..    - Blind carbon copy address/es
   -f     address*     - email address of the sender
   -sub   subject      - subject
   -l     file         - a file containing the email addresses
   -a     file         - attach this file
   -y     mime type    - MIME type for the attached file
   -m     file         - include this text file
   -v                  - verbose mode
   -help               - shows this help

The options with * must the specified
Example:
mailsend -f muquit@muquitcom -d example.com -smtp mail.example.com -t muquit@
muquit.com -sub test -a file.gif -y 'image/gif'

The options with * must the specified

Interactive usage:
If you run the program  without any argument, it will ask for
SMTP server address/IP, Domain, From, To, Cc, Bcc, Subject and mail body.
Type the mail and press . in a line and press Enter to end the mail.
Press Ctrl+C to abort.

Non-interactive usage:
The program reads the message from stdin. so you can write your message in a
file and specify the file with -m flag or feed it from stdin.

Example:
    mailsend -d muquit.com -smtp 1.2.3.4 -t muquit@muquit.com -f muquit@muquit.com  -sub "test" -m msg.txt

    or

    mailsend -d muquit.com -smtp 1.2.3.4 -t muquit@muquit.com -f muquit@muquit.com  -sub "test" < msg.txt

A file can also be used as an address list containing one address in 
each line, which can be specified with -l flag.

Also a file can be created with smtp server, from, to, cc, bcc, subject
and mail body which can be used as a single input to the prgram. For
example, if you create a file like below:


1.2.3.4
example.com
foo@example.com
bar@example.com
Mail body starts here.
This file can be used to feed to the mailsend program.

The first line is the smtp server addess or IP address.
The second line is the domain used in SMTP HELO. 
The third line is the From address.
The fourth line the To address/es. They can be command separated.
Right after the From, the mail body starts.


Now this file can be fed to the program as follows:
mailsend -v < msg.txt

Note: No Cc, Bcc or Subject can be specified in this file. Use the 
appropriate flags if you want to use them.

You can see the mail getting delivered if you specify the -v flag.

If you find the program useful, please let me know.

ChangeLog:

    * minimal MIME support. Mar-08-2002 

    * If no message file specified and if nothing is fed from stdin, only
       then ask for Cc, Bcc and subject.
