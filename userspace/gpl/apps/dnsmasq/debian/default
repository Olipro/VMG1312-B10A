# This file has four functions: 
# 1) to completely disable starting dnsmasq, 
# 2) to set DOMAIN_SUFFIX by running `dnsdomainname` 
# 3) to select an alternative config file
#    by setting DNSMASQ_OPTS to --conf-file=<file>
# 4) to tell dnsmasq to read the files in /etc/dnsmasq.d for
#    more configuration variables.

# For upgraders from very old versions, all the shell variables set 
# here in previous versions are still honored by the init script
# so if you just keep your old version of this file nothing will break.

#DOMAIN_SUFFIX=`dnsdomainname`
#DNSMASQ_OPTS="--conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq.alt"

# Whether or not to run the dnsmasq daemon; set to 0 to disable.
ENABLED=1

# By default search this drop directory for configuration options.
# Libvirt leaves a file here to make the system dnsmasq play nice.
# Comment out this line if you don't want this.
