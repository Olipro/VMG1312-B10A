Description: A small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server
 Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP
 server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a 
 small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are 
 not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS 
 server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses
 to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or
 in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic 
 DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.

Description: A small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server
 This package contains the dnsmasq executable and documentation, but
 not the infrastructure required to run it as a system daemon. For
 that, install the dnsmasq package.
