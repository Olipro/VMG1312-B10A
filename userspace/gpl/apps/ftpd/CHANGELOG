This file contains all major changes made during the development of bftpd.
The uppermost change is the newest one.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.24
	- The PATH_BFTPDUTMP configuration option was added (idea by Szabo Peter
	  <pts@math.bme.hu>).
	- Whenever a data connection is established, the reply message now
	  contains the transfer mode (idea by Szabo Peter).
	- The -D, -h and -n command line options have been added (idea by Szabo
	  Peter). Some code was changed to support operation without a configuration
	  file.
	- ATTENTION! The option LOGFILE has changed. See sample config file.
	- In daemon mode, bftpd closes its sockets correctly now (important if you
	  have a lot of connections), problem discovered by Olivier Kaloudoff.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented Mozilla from getting directory lists (found
	  by Marc Pauls).
	- Daniel Mack fixed a memory leak in his code.
	- The configuration parser handles comments better now.
	- The USERLIMIT_GLOBAL configuration option has been added.
	- The USERLIMIT_SINGLEUSER configuration option has been added.
	- Some memory leaks discovered by David Heine <dlheine@suif.stanford.edu>
	  were fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.23
    - A serious file corruption bug using sendfile was fixed.
    - A makefile bug was fixed.
    - The AUTO_CHDIR and HIDE_GROUP configuration options were added.
    - A bug in the RNFR and RNTO functions has been fixed.
    - A bug occuring when compiling on StrongARM has been fixed.
    - The config file has been made more tolerant to missing spaces (error
      reported by Saus101 <Saus101@prime.gushi.org>).
    - A bug in the HELP function was fixed.
    - Two BSD incompatibilities have been fixed.
    - A STAT bug was fixed.
	- bftpd now follows symlinks.
	- A bug in the daemonmode code was fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.22
    - The ALLOW_FXP configuration option has been added.
    - The DATA_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added.
    - The PASSIVE_PORTS configuration option has been added.
    - A control timeout bug has been fixed.
    - Configuration options are now written like name="value", allowing
      comments after the option. Directories are written like
      directory "/foo/bar" {. Please update your config files!
    - bftpdutmp logging has been implemented as well as some administration
      functions using it. Read the updated documentation for details on how
      to use them.
    - You needn't link gzip statically to bftpd any more if you want on-the-fly
      compression, but you can dynamically link against zlib instead now.
      The pax sources are still needed for tar on-the-fly.
    - A directory listing bug reported by Hendrik Harms
      <hendrik.harms@bigfoot.de> has been fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.21
    - The XFER_BUFSIZE configuration option has been added, allowing tweaking
      of data throughput. If you and your clients are on a very fast network
      (fast meaning 100 Mbit/s or more), you should set this to 64000 or
      something like that.
    - The APPE command has been implemented.
    - The ALLO command has been implemented as an alias to NOOP.
    - The INITAL_CHROOT configuration option has been added. See the new
      example config file for details.
    - The ability to disable logging has been added :)
    - A bug making file transmissions impossible with old config files has
      been fixed.
    - A bug concerning file truncating when STORing has been fixed.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.20
    - The FEAT function has been implemented.
    - A permission bug in the STOR function has been fixed.
    - The UMASK configuration option can now be used directory-specifically.
    - The EPSV and EPRT functions have been implemented, making IPv6 support
      possible somewhere in the future.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.19
    - The NLST function has been made usable again. There has been an
      unnoticed bug in it since the globbing function has been implemented.
    - The XCWD, XCUP, XMKD, XRMD and XPWD functions have been implemented
      as aliases to CWD, CDUP, MKD, RMD and PWD.
    - The documentation is now in the SGML format, making it more extensible,
      hopefully.
    - The DATAPORT20 configuration option has been added. If set to yes,
      the server will open data connections from port 20, which should make
      firewall users happier.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.18
    - The configuration file has been restructured. See README for details.
    - The PORT configuration option has been added, allowing you to change
      the port number the daemon should listen on (only for daemon mode).
    - A workaround for the /*/../* vulnerability mentioned on Bugtraq has
      been added, although it's not the right thing to do, really.
    - Compatibility to Solaris 8 has been improved. Josh Woodcock
      <josh@hamparts.com> and Michael Smirnov <smb@mh.vstu.edu.ru> gave
      some hints.
    - The CONTROL_TIMEOUT configuration option has been added. You can now
      say after how many seconds of idle time users should be kicked.
    - Hashes (#) in /etc/passwd and /etc/group are now supported as comments.
      This improves FreeBSD compatibility, I'm not sure about other systems.

Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.17
	- A globbing bug was fixed, making Midnight Commander able to connect
	  to bftpd.
    - A bug which appeared when doing LIST if a group line in /etc/group
      had more than 256 characters was fixed.
    - /etc/shells and /etc/ftpusers authentication were implemented by
      Christophe Bailleux.
    - You can now indent your configuration options with tabulators.
    - A small problem with the ip_conntrack_ftp kernel module has been fixed,
      which was the fault of ip_conntrack_ftp. It was found by Erik Hensema
      <erik@hensema.xs4all.nl>.
    - ASCII transfer mode has been implemented.
    - You can now prevent a user from executing specific commands by using
      the ALLOWCOMMAND_XXXX=no option.

	  README file if you want to do that.

	  fixed.
	- A bug making the server crash when logging in a non-existent user
	  with ANONYMOUS_USER enabled was fixed.
	- A patch supplied by Christophe Bailleux was applied, changing the
	  following:
	    - Spaces after a command in each command string are removed.
	    - The HELP command was implemented.
	    - CWD to ~ now works.
	  
Max-Wilhelm Bruker <brukie@gmx.net> -> 1.0.15
	- You can override the default path to the config file with the command
	  line parameter '-c'.
	- wtmp logging was implemented, so that bftpd logins show up in

	  interface.

	  Bailleux <cb@grolier.fr> was fixed.
	- The SITE CHMOD and SITE CHOWN commands were implemented. You can turn
	  them off in the config file.
	- A lot of useful changes proposed by Heiko Rother <rother@cmsnet.de>
          were made:
		- Standalone mode, independent from inetd
    	- Better support for symbolic links
