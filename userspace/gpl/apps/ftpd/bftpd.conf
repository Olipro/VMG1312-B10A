  #You can force bftpd to use a specific port range in passive mode.
  #Passive mode means that the client will open data connections
  #and the server stays 'passive'.
  #This option can be very useful with some firewall configurations.
  #Seperate values with "," and define ranges with "-".
  #bftpd will try to bind one of these ports in ascending order as
  #you specify them here.

  #is refused. If you want to bind any free port in that case, add
  #"0" to the list.

  #If PORT data connections should be opened from port 20, say yes here. You
  #will probably need this if your server is behind a firewall that restricts

  #With this option, you can put your entire FTP environment into a chroot
  #jail. Apart from security, this offers you the possibility of having
  #virtual users that don't exist in the system.
  #Additionally, you can make some kind of 'file pool' by creating a directory
  #with files which you can symlink from the users' homes (this means setting
  #DO_CHROOT=no in order for the users to be able to access that dir.
  #Note that you need the following files in your initial chroot directory:
  #/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group
  #On GNU systems, you will also need the NSS libraries in /lib.

  #The bftpdutmp file enables you to record user logins and logouts in
  #bftpd, which is useful for the administration interface (which is not

  #of users simultaneously logged on, and so on.
  #Note that the directory in which the file resides must already exist.
