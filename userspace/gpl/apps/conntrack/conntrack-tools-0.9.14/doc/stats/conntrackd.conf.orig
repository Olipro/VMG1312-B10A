	# Event filtering: This clause allows you to filter certain traffic,
	# There are currently three filter-sets: Protocol, Address and
	# State. The filter is attached to an action that can be: Accept or
	# Ignore. Thus, you can define the event filtering policy of the
	# filter-sets in positive or negative logic depending on your needs.

	Filter {
		#
		# Accept only certain protocols: You may want to log the
		# state of flows depending on their layer 4 protocol.

		Protocol Accept {
			TCP
		}

		#
		# Ignore traffic for a certain set of IP's.
		#
		Address Ignore {
			IPv4_address 127.0.0.1 # loopback
		}

		#
		# Uncomment this line below if you want to filter by flow state.
		# The existing TCP states are: SYN_SENT, SYN_RECV, ESTABLISHED,
		# FIN_WAIT, CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, TIME_WAIT, CLOSED, LISTEN.

		# State Accept {

	# By default, the daemon receives state updates following an
	# event-driven model. You can modify this behaviour by switching to
	# polling mode with the PollSecs clause. This clause tells conntrackd
	# to dump the states in the kernel every N seconds. With regards to
	# synchronization mode, the polling mode can only guarantee that
	# long-lifetime states are recovered. The main advantage of this method
	# is the reduction in the state replication at the cost of reducing the
	# chances of recovering connections.
	#
	# PollSecs 15

	#
	# Enable connection logging via Syslog. Default is off.
	# Syslog: on, off or a facility name (daemon (default) or local0..7)
	# If you set the facility, use the same as in the General clause, 
	# otherwise you'll get a warning message.
