This target marks packes so that the kernel will log every rule which match 
the packets as those traverse the tables, chains, rules. (The ip6t_LOG module 
is required for the logging.) The packets are logged with the string prefix: 
"TRACE: tablename:chainname:type:rulenum " where type can be "rule" for 
plain rule, "return" for implicit rule at the end of a user defined chain 
and "policy" for the policy of the built in chains.

It can only be used in the
.BR raw
table.
