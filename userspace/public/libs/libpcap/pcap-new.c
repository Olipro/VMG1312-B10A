/*! \ingroup remote_func
	\brief It creates a list of network devices that can be opened with pcap_open().
	
	This function is a superset of the old 'pcap_findalldevs()', which is obsolete, and which
	allows listing only the devices present on the local machine.
	Vice versa, pcap_findalldevs_ex() allows listing the devices present on a remote 
	machine as well. Moreover, pcap_findalldevs_ex() is platform independent, since it
	relies on the standard pcap_findalldevs() to get addresses on the local machine.

	In case the function has to list the interfaces on a remote machine, it opens a new control
	connection toward that machine, it retrieves the interfaces, and it drops the connection.
	However, if this function detects that the remote machine is in 'active' mode,
	the connection is not dropped (see the 'sockctrl' parameters for more details).
	In the same way, if we're in active mode and the connection is already opened, it
	uses the existing socket.

	This function can rely on the pcap_createsrcstr() to create the string that keeps
	the capture device according to	the new syntax, and the pcap_parsesrcstr() for the
	other way round.

	\param host: a char* buffer that keeps the address of the remote host on which 
	we want to see the interface list.
	It can be NULL: in this case the function queries the local host for the locally
	installed interfaces. The address can be both numeric (e.g. '10.11.12.13', '1:2:3::4')
	and literal (e.g. 'foo.bar.com').

	\param auth: a pointer to a pcap_rmtauth structure. This pointer keeps the information
	required to authenticate the RPCAP connection to the remote host.
	This parameter is not meaningful in case of a query to the local host: in that case
	it can be NULL.

	\param sockctrl: Socket to be used for the control connection.
	This parameter is meaningful only if the control connection is already open when the 
	pcap_findalldevs() is called. This can be the case in which the 'ative' mode is used, 
	in which the capturing machine opens a control connection toward the client in order 
	to bypass in-middle firewalls. In that case, the control connection is already open, 
	and we have to use this one instead of opening a new one.

	In case this parameter is non-zero, the 'host' and 'port' parameters are meaningless:
	the software will always try to retrieve the network adapters using this control
	connection, despite the value assumed by 'host' and 'port'.
	In case this parameter is non-zero, the socket is not closed at the end of the function
	and it remains open for future use.

	\param port: a char* buffer (e.g. "2003") that keeps the network port on which we 
	want to connect to.
	It can be NULL: in this case the function uses the standard port, defined in 
	RPCAP_DEFAULT_NETPORT.

	\param alldevs: a 'struct pcap_if_t' pointer, which will be properly allocated inside
	this function. When the function returns, it is set to point to the first element 
	of the interface list; each element of the list is of type 'struct pcap_if_t'.

	\param errbuf: a pointer to a user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE)
	that will contain the error message (in case there is one).

	\return '0' if everything is fine, '-1' if some errors occurred. The list of the devices 
	is returned in the 'alldevs' variable.
	When the function returns correctly, 'alldevs' cannot be NULL. In other words, this 
	function returns '-1' also in case the system does not have any interface to list.

	The error message is returned in the 'errbuf' variable. An error could be due to 
	several reasons:
	- libpcap/WinPcap was not installed on the local/remote host
	- the user does not have enough privileges to list the devices
	- a network problem
	- the RPCAP version negotiation failed
	- other errors (not enough memory and others).
	
	\warning There may be network devices that cannot be opened with pcap_open() by the process
	calling pcap_findalldevs(), because, for example, that process might not have
	sufficient privileges to open them for capturing; if so, those devices will not 
	appear on the list.

	\warning The interface list must be deallocated manually by using the pcap_freealldevs().

	\brief Accepts a set of strings (host name, port, ...), and it returns the complete 
	source string according to the new format (e.g. 'rpcap://1.2.3.4/eth0').

	This function is provided in order to help the user to create the source string
	according to the new format.
	An unique source string is used in order to make easy for old applications to use the
	remote facilities. Think about tcpdump, for example, which has only one way to specify
	the interface on which the capture has to be started.
	However, GUI-based programs can find more useful to specify hostname, port and
	interface name separately. In that case, they can use this function to create the 
	source string before passing it to the pcap_open() function.

	\param source: a user-allocated buffer that will contain the complete source string
	wen the function returns.
	This function assumes that the allocated buffer is at least PCAP_BUF_SIZE bytes.

	\param type: its value tells the type of the source we want to create. It can assume 
	the following values:
	- PCAP_SRC_FILE: if we want a local file
	- PCAP_SRC_IFLOCAL: if we want a local interface
	- PCAP_SRC_IFREMOTE: if we want a remote interface

	\param host: an user-allocated buffer that keeps the host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") we 
	want to connect to.
	It can be NULL in case we want to open an interface on a local host.

	\param port: an user-allocated buffer that keeps the network port (e.g. "2002") we 
	want to use for the RPCAP protocol.
	It can be NULL in case we want to open an interface on a local host.

	\param name: an user-allocated buffer that keeps the interface name we want to use
	(e.g. "eth0").

	\param errbuf: a pointer to a user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE)
	that will contain the error message (in case there is one).

	\return '0' if everything is fine, '-1' if some errors occurred. The string containing
	the complete source is returned in the 'source' variable.

	\brief Parses the source string and returns the pieces in which the source can be split.

	This call is the other way round of pcap_createsrcstr().
	It accepts a null-terminated string and it returns the parameters related 
	to the source. This includes:
	- the type of the source (file, winpcap on a remote adapter, winpcap on local adapter),
	which is determined by the source prefix (PCAP_SRC_IF_KEY and so on)
	- the host on which the capture has to be started (only for remote captures)
	- the 'raw' name of the source (file name, name of the remote adapter, name 
	of the local adapter), without the source prefix. The string returned does not 
	include the type of the source itself (i.e. the string returned does not include "file://" 
	or rpcap:// or such).

	The user can omit some parameters in case it is not interested in them.

	\param source: a null-terminated string containing the WinPcap source

	\param type: pointer to an integer, which is used to return the code corrisponding to the 
	selected source. The code will be one of the following:
		- PCAP_SRC_FILE
		- PCAP_SRC_IFLOCAL
		- PCAP_SRC_IFREMOTE
	In case the source string does not exists (i.e. 'source == NULL') or it is empty
	('*source == NULL'), it returns PCAP_SRC_IF_LOCAL (i.e. you are ready to 
	call pcap_open_live() ). This behavior is kept only for compatibility with older 
	applications (e.g. tcpdump); therefore we suggest to move to the new syntax for sources.

	This parameter can be NULL in case the user is not interested in that.

	\param host: user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_BUF_SIZE) that is used to return 
	the host name on which the capture has to be started.
	This value is meaningful only in case of remote capture; otherwise, the returned 
	string will be empty ("").
	This parameter can be NULL in case the user is not interested in that.

	\param port: user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_BUF_SIZE) that is used to return 
	the port that has to be used by the RPCAP protocol to contact the other host.
	This value is meaningful only in case of remote capture and if the user wants to use
	a non-standard port; otherwise, the returned string will be empty ("").
	In case of remote capture, an emply string means "use the standard RPCAP port".
	This parameter can be NULL in case the user is not interested in that.

	\param name: user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_BUF_SIZE) that is used to return 
	the source name, without the source prefix.
	If the name does not exist (for example because source contains 'rpcap://' that means 
	'default local adapter'), it returns NULL.
	This parameter can be NULL in case the user is not interested in that.

	\param errbuf: pointer to a user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE)
	that will contain the error message (in case there is one).
	This parameter can be NULL in case the user is not interested in that.

/*!	\ingroup remote_func

	\brief It opens a generic source in order to capture / send (WinPcap only) traffic.
	
	The pcap_open() replaces all the pcap_open_xxx() functions with a single call.

	This function hides the differences between the different pcap_open_xxx() functions
	so that the programmer does not have to manage different opening function.
	In this way, the 'true' open function is decided according to the source type,
	which is included into the source string (in the form of source prefix).

	This function can rely on the pcap_createsrcstr() to create the string that keeps
	the capture device according to	the new syntax, and the pcap_parsesrcstr() for the
	other way round.

	\param source: zero-terminated string containing the source name to open.
	The source name has to include the format prefix according to the 
	syntax proposed by WinPcap. It cannot be NULL.
	On on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device argument of "any"
	 (i.e. rpcap://any) can be used to capture packets from all interfaces.
	 <br>
	In case the pcap_createsrcstr() is not used, remember that the new source 
	syntax allows for these formats to be used in the pcap_open():
	- file://filename [we want to open a local file]
	- rpcap://host.foo.bar/adaptername [everything literal, no port number]
	- rpcap://host.foo.bar:1234/adaptername [everything literal, with port number]
	- rpcap://10.11.12.13/adaptername [IPv4 numeric, no port number]
	- rpcap://10.11.12.13:1234/adaptername [IPv4 numeric, with port number]
	- rpcap://[10.11.12.13]:1234/adaptername [IPv4 numeric with IPv6 format, with port number]
	- rpcap://[1:2:3::4]/adaptername [IPv6 numeric, no port number]
	- rpcap://[1:2:3::4]:1234/adaptername [IPv6 numeric, with port number]
	- rpcap://adaptername [local adapter, opened without using the RPCAP protocol]
	- adaptername [to open a local adapter; kept for compability, but it is strongly discouraged]
	- (NULL) [to open the first local adapter; kept for compability, but it is strongly discouraged]
	
	The following formats are not allowed:
	- rpcap:// [to open the first local adapter]
	- rpcap://hostname/ [to open the first remote adapter]

	\param snaplen: length of the packet that has to be retained.	
	For each packet received by the filter, only the first 'snaplen' bytes are stored 
	in the buffer and passed to the user application. For instance, snaplen equal to 
	100 means that only the first 100 bytes of each packet are stored.

  	\param flags: keeps several flags that can be needed for capturing packets.
	The allowed flags are the following:
	- PCAP_OPENFLAG_PROMISCUOUS: if the adapter has to go in promiscuous mode.		
	It is '1' if you have to open the adapter in promiscuous mode, '0' otherwise.
	Note that even if this parameter is false, the interface could well be in promiscuous
	mode for some other reason (for example because another capture process with 
	promiscuous mode enabled is currently using that interface).
	On on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels (that have the "any" device), this
	flag does not work on the "any" device; if an argument of "any" is supplied,
	the 'promisc' flag is ignored.
	- PCAP_OPENFLAG_SERVEROPEN_DP: it specifies who is responsible for opening the data
	connection in case of a remote capture (it means 'server open data path').
	If it is '1', it specifies if the data connection has to be intitiated 
	by the capturing device (which becomes like 'active'). If '0', the connection 
	will be initiated by the client workstation.
	This flag is used to overcome the problem of firewalls, which allow
	only outgoing connections. In that case, the capturing device can open
	a connection toward the client workstation in order to allow the
	data trasfer.
	In fact, the data connection is opened using a random port (while the
	control connection uses a standard port), so it is hard to configure
	a firewall to permit traffic on the data path.
	This flag is meaningless if the source is not a remote interface.
	Addictionally, it is meaningless if the data connection is done using
	the UDP protocol, since in this case the connection wil always be opened
	by the server.
	In these cases, it is simply ignored.
	- PCAP_OPENFLAG_UDP_DP: it specifies if the data trasfer (in case of a remote
	capture) has to be done with UDP protocol.
	If it is '1' if you want a UDP data connection, '0' if you want
	a TCP data connection; control connection is always TCP-based.
	A UDP connection is much lighter, but it does not guarantee that all
	the captured packets arrive to the client workstation. Moreover, 
	it could be harmful in case of network congestion.
	This flag is meaningless if the source is not a remote interface.
	In that case, it is simply ignored.

	\param read_timeout: read timeout in milliseconds.
	The read timeout is used to arrange that the read not necessarily return
	immediately when a packet is seen, but that it waits for some amount of 
	time to allow more packets to arrive and to read multiple packets from 
	the OS kernel in one operation. Not all platforms support a read timeout;
	on platforms that don't, the read timeout is ignored.

	\param auth: a pointer to a 'struct pcap_rmtauth' that keeps the information required to
	authenticate the user on a remote machine. In case this is not a remote capture, this
	pointer can be set to NULL.

	\param errbuf: a pointer to a user-allocated buffer which will contain the error
	in case this function fails. The pcap_open() and findalldevs() are the only two
	functions which have this parameter, since they do not have (yet) a pointer to a
	pcap_t structure, which reserves space for the error string. Since these functions
	do not have (yet) a pcap_t pointer (the pcap_t pointer is NULL in case of errors),
	they need an explicit 'errbuf' variable.
	'errbuf' may also be set to warning text when pcap_open_live() succeds; 
	to detect this case the caller should store a  zero-length string in  
	'errbuf' before calling pcap_open_live() and display the warning to the user 
	if 'errbuf' is no longer a zero-length string.

	\return A pointer to a 'pcap_t' which can be used as a parameter to the following
	calls (pcap_compile() and so on) and that specifies an opened WinPcap session. In case of 
	problems, it returns NULL and the 'errbuf' variable keeps the error message.

	\warning The source cannot be larger than PCAP_BUF_SIZE.

/*!	\ingroup remote_func

	\brief It blocks until a network connection is accepted (active mode only).

	This function has been defined to allow the client dealing with the 'active mode'.
	In other words, in the 'active mode' the server opens the connection toward the
	client, so that the client has to open a socket in order to wait for connections.
	When a new connection is accepted, the RPCAP protocol starts as usual; the only 
	difference is that the connection is initiated by the server.

	This function accepts only ONE connection, then it closes the waiting socket. This means
	that if some error occurs, the application has to call it again in order to accept another
	connection.

	This function returns when a new connection (coming from a valid host 'connectinghost')
	is accepted; it returns error otherwise.

	\param address: a string that keeps the network address we have to bind to; 
	usually it is NULL (it means 'bind on all local addresses').

	\param port: a string that keeps the network port on which we have to bind to; usually
	it is NULL (it means 'bind on the predefined port', i.e. RPCAP_DEFAULT_NETPORT_ACTIVE).

	\param hostlist: a string that keeps the host name of the host from whom we are
	expecting a connection; it can be NULL (it means 'accept connection from everyone').
	Host names are separated by a whatever character in the RPCAP_HOSTLIST_SEP list.

	\param connectinghost: a user-allocated buffer that will contain the name of the host
	is trying to connect to us.
	This variable must be at least RPCAP_HOSTLIST_SIZE bytes..

	\param auth: a pointer to a pcap_rmtauth structure. This pointer keeps the information
	required to authenticate the RPCAP connection to the remote host.

	\param errbuf: a pointer to a user-allocated buffer (of size PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE)
	that will contain the error message (in case there is one).

	\return The SOCKET identifier of the new control connection if everything is fine,
	a negative number if some errors occurred. The error message is returned into the errbuf variable.
	In case it returns '-1', this means 'everything is fine', but the host cannot be admitted.
	In case it returns '-2', in means 'unrecoverable error' (for example it is not able to bind the 
	socket, or something like that).
	In case it returns '-3', it means 'authentication failed'. The authentication check is performed
	only if the connecting host is among the ones that are allowed to connect to this host.

	The host that is connecting to us is returned into the hostlist variable, which ust be allocated
	by the user. This variable contains the host name both in case the host is allowed, 
	and in case the connection is refused.

	\warning Although this function returns the socket established by the new control connection,
	this value should not be used. This value will be stored into some libpcap internal
	variables and it will be managed automatically by the library. In other words, all the
	following calls to findalldevs() and pcap_open() will check if the host is among one that
	already has a control connection in place; if so, that one will be used.

	\warning This function has several problems if used inside a thread, which is stopped
	when this call is blocked into the accept(). In this case, the socket on which we accept
	connections is not freed (thread termination is a very dirty job), so that we are no
	longer able to accept other connections until the program (i.e. the process) stops.
	In order to solve the problem, call the pcap_remoteact_cleanup().
