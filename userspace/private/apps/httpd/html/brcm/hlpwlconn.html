    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and
      rerun the diagnostics tests by clicking on the <b>Rerun Diagnostic Tests</b>
      button at the bottom of this page. If all the tests pass, close and restart
      your Web browser to access the Internet.</P>
    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Verify that the Wireless configurations
          from your computer and your Broadband Router are matched and corrected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn off the Broadband Router, wait 10 seconds and turn it back ON. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With the router on, press the reset button on the Broadband Router
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the Broadband Router
          to its default settings. Wait for the Broadband Router to initialize,
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the router, type
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
      </li>
