    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and

      button at the bottom of this page. If all the tests pass, close and restart 
      your Web browser to access the Internet.</P>
    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>If there is no connection to the USB port of the Broadband Router, this test 
          should fail. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>If you are not able to access this page, verify that the USB cable 
          from your computer or your hub is connected to the LAN port on the DSL 
          Router. Reseat the USB cable by unplugging both ends and reconnecting 
          them to their respective ports. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the Broadband Router, wait 10 seconds and turn it back ON. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the router on, press the reset button on the Broadband Router for at 
        least five seconds and release it. This resets the Broadband Router to its 
        default settings. Wait for the Broadband Router to initialize, then close and 
        restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the router, type your DSL 
        Account username and password.</p>
