    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and

      Troubleshoot the <i>Test ADSL Synchronization</i> test first. </p>

      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the DSL modem, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the DSL modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the DSL modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the DSL modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>

        <p>If this is the first time you are setting up your DSL modem, you may 
          need to reconfigure your VPI/VCI settings. Contact ISP Technical Support
