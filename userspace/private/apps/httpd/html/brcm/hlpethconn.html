    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and

    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>If you are not able to access this page, verify that the Ethernet cable 
          from your computer or your hub is connected to the LAN port on DSL 
        Router. 
          Reseat the cable by unplugging both ends and reconnecting them to their 
          respective ports. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the Broadband Router, wait 10 seconds and turn it back ON. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Make sure you are using the Ethernet cable supplied with your DSL 
        Router</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the router on, press the reset button on the Broadband Router 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the Broadband Router 
          to its default settings. Wait for the Broadband Router to initialize, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the router, type 
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
      </li>
