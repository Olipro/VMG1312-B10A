    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and 
      rerun the diagnostics tests by clicking on the <b>Rerun Diagnostic Tests</b> 
      button at the bottom of this page. If all the tests pass, close and restart 
      your Web browser to access the Internet.</P>
    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <P>NOTE: If <i>Ping Default Gateway</i> fails, this test result displays N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the DSL modem, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back on. Wait 
          at least one minute for the modem to completely restart and to establish 
          a connection. If the PPPoE LED on the modem turns solid green, close 
          your Web browser and restart it. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the DSL modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the DSL modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the DSL modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
      </li>
