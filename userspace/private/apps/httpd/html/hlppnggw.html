    <P>NOTE: If <i>Test the assigned IP address</i> fails, this test result displays 
      N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off the DSL modem, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back on. Wait at 
        least one minute for the modem to completely restart and to establish 
        a connection. If the PPPoE LED is on the modem turns solid green, close 
        your Web browser and restart it. </li>
