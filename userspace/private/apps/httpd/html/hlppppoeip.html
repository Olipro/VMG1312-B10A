    <P>NOTE: If <i>Test authentication to ISP</i> fails, this test result displays 
      N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>After turning on your DSL modem, wait for at least one minute to establish 
          a connection. Run the diagnostic tests again by clicking on the <b>Rerun 
          Diagnostic Tests</b> button at the bottom of this page. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the power to the DSL modem, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back 
          on. Wait at least one minute for the modem to completely restart and 
          to establish a connection. If the PPP light on the modem turns solid 
          green, close your Web browser and restart it. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the DSL modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the DSL modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the DSL modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
