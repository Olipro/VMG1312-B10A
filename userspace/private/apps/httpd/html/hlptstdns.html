    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and 
      rerun the diagnostics tests by clicking on the <b>Rerun Diagnostic Tests</b>

    <P>NOTE: If <i>Ping Primary Domain Name Server</i> fails, this test result 
      displays N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>Turn off the DSL modem, wait 10 seconds, and turn it back on. Wait 
          at least one minute for the modem to completely restart and to establish 
          a connection. If the PPPoE LED is on and the modem turns solid green, 
          close your Web browser then restart it. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the DSL modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it. This resets the DSL modem 
          to its default settings. Wait for the DSL modem to completely restart, 
          then close and restart your Web browser. To reconfigure the modem, type 
          your DSL Account username and password.</p>
