    <P>If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting procedures listed below and

    <P><B>Troubleshooting:</B></P>
    <P>NOTE: If <i>Test PPP server connection</i> fails, this test result displays 
      N/A. 
    <ol>
      <li> 
        <p>After turning on your DSL modem, wait for at least one minute to establish 
          a connection. Run the diagnostic tests again by clicking on the <b>Rerun 
          Diagnostic Tests</b> button at the bottom of this page. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>If this is the first time you are configuring your DSL modem, your 
          username and password are case sensitive; make sure your <i>Caps Lock</i> 
          key on your keyboard is not enabled. When prompted to type your username, 
          type your full email address. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>With the modem on, press the external reset button on the DSL modem 
          for at least five seconds and release it, wait for it to completely 
          restart, then close and restart your Web browser. This resets the DSL 
          modem to its default settings. To reconfigure the modem, type your DSL 
          Account username and password . </p>
      </li>
      <li> If your DSL has been working properly for a long period of time and 
        you are suddenly experiencing this problem, there may be a problem with 
        the DSL network.You may need to wait from 30 minutes to a couple of hours, 
        and if you are still experiencing this problem, try turning off the modem 
        and wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. Wait a couple of minutes and 
        if the DSL and PPP LEDs on the modem remain a solid color, close your 
        Web browser and restart it. If the LEDs do not go solid, contact ISP Technical 
        Support. </li>
    </ol>
