/*
 * Sequence commands.
 *
 * Command sequencing is a mechanism whereby multiple IOCTL commands, with
 * possible delays inserted, are sent to the driver. The driver doesn't
 * actually run the IOCTLs until it has received the entire list.
 *
 * The start of a sequence is indicated by the seq_start IOVAR, and the end
 * of the sequence by the seq_stop IOVAR. The driver queues all IOCTLs/IOVARs
 * it receives until the seq_stop is received.
 *
 * When a seq_stop is received:
 *		-	The firmware will begin at the head of the queue and issue ioctls
 *			to the wlc code sequentially.
 * 	- 	If a seq_delay is encountered in the queue, it will spin for the
 *			indicated amount of time, at which point the next ioctl will be
 *			fetched and passed to the wlc code
 * 	- 	As each ioctl is completed, the associated list element that was
 *			malloc'd will be free'd.
 * 	- 	If any of the individual batch commands fail, the sequence will
 *			be aborted, the remaining queued ioctls will be free'd and an
 *			error indication will be passed back for the entire sequence.
 * 	- 	If all batched commands are processed successfully, then a success
 *			indication will be returned and the driver will return to normal
 *			IOCTL processing mode.
 *
 *	In order to reduce the number of transactions, the seq_list may be used
 * as a container IOVAR. It is used to concatenate a series of IOCTLs/IOVARs
 * into a single contiguous buffer and pass the entire sequence to the driver
 * using a single transaction.
 *
 * Because of the nature of the batching, it is suited towards a series of
 * set commands. IOCTLs/IOVARS that query information are not supported.
